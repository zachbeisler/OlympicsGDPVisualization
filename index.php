	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>For our project, we found data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on a wide variety of labor statistics by year and specific area code. The data spans multiple decades and records statistics among multiple categories. Beyond that, area and statistic codes are all from different data sources and many of the different types of labor categories are in different tables as well. </p>
	
	<h3>Aim</h3>
	<p>The aim of project is to find statistical trends of labor statistics among different areas or over time. We believe that with this much data on a wide variety of different statistics, there should be some very pronounced trends in the data. Integrating and fusing many of these related datasets could lead to an easier way to analyze this data to look at trends for the future. </p>
