NOTE: The link to the website in the PDF final report is no longer working. Due to a new Penn State Website policy, a good chunk of JavaScript and PHP code was lost forever on their servers. The database being hosted by Penn State has also been cleaned out, meaning that none of the data will load anymore. Pictures of what the completed site looked like can be found in the PDF final report.
